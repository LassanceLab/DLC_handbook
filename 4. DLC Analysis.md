Fill all information.

> [!note]
Number of cameras refers to the amount of cameras filming the same animal, e.g. top and side view.
Make sure to check “Copy videos to project folder”. We encountered one instance of test videos getting corrupted during the analysis

> [!warning]
Do NOT include special characters (e.g. ô é ä etc) in the project name or the experimenter name! This WILL cause issues during the analysis. See [[XX. Common errors and fixes#XX.2.1 Literally Any DLC Error Message]]
