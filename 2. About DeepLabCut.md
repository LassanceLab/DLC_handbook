The core idea behind DeepLabCut is to train a neural network to recognize and track specific body parts or landmarks in a video. This training process involves labeling a set of example frames with the desired body parts, allowing the network to learn the visual features associated with each landmark. Once trained, the network can automatically track these landmarks in new videos, providing precise and reliable tracking results.

## 2.3 Donating Data  
As of June 2023, the DLC team was keen to obtain more data for non-standard rodent models.  
`[!!flag:Review]` Refer to [3. Getting Started > 3.2 Choose Appropriate Keypoints](3.%20Getting%20Started.md#3.2%20Choose%20Appropriate%20Keypoints) to see how to set up a new project in accordance with their desired data layout, and see ==INSERT SECTION NAME HERE== to see how to export the data and submit it to them.
