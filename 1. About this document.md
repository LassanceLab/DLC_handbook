## 1.1 General Things
This documentation assumes that you have prior knowledge of DeepLabCut and all other software mentioned.
Please read the appropriate documentation before starting your work.

A very short introduction to DeepLabCut with links can be found at [[2. About DeepLabCut]].

## 1.2 Maintenance of This Document
This documentation was created in June 2023 by Thorbjörn Sievert (Lassance Lab, GIGA Neurosciences, University of Liège, Belgium).

This document has been written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and should be available as an [[1. About this Document#1.2.4 Export as HTML|HTML]] file for easy reading and sharing, as well as in Obsidian for editing and reading.

### 1.2.1 Template
Each new note *should* be created automatically with the [[basic_template]]. This template adds a series of frontmattter/YAML metadata to each note:

```YAML
created_by: Thorbjörn Sievert
edited_by:
  - {{name}}
  - {{name}}
  - {{name}}
  - Thorbjörn Sievert
Created_at: <% tp.file.creation_date() %>
Modified_at: 
tags: 
  - {{tag1}}
  - {{tag2}}
alias: 
  - {{alias1}}
  - {{alias2}}
```

`created_by`: who created the note.
`edited_by`: list of authors who have edited the note. Please add your name towards the bottom of the list. Newest at the top.
`Created_ at`: command based on the Templater plugin. Will automatically add the current date when a new note is created.
`Modified_at`: is populated by the installed linter. Will update on `Ctrl + S`. See [[1. About this Document#1.2.3 Linter]]
`tags`: can be added to group different notes with similar topics. Remove curly brackets {{}} to add a tag.
`alias`: can be added to add an alias for the title. E.g. DLC as an alias for DeepLabCut. The alias can then be found in the search.

### 1.2.2 Changelog
This vault has two changelogs: [[Automatic_Changelog]] and [[1. Human readable changelog]].
[[Automatic_Changelog]] is automatically populated via a plugin, but not very informative. Its main purpose is to inform the manual writing of a proper changelog in [[1. Human readable changelog]].

> [!warning] Important
> Please remember to write a proper changelog after each change!

### 1.2.3 Linter
This vault has a linter installed.
In case you don’t know what that means, it forces a consistent format across all notes in this vault.
It can be manually triggered with `Ctrl + Alt + L` to format the current file, or with `Ctrl + Alt + A` for all files in the vault.
Additionally, manually saving via `Ctrl + S` will also trigger the linter.

> [!note]
> As of July 2023, the note will be linted automatically when you switch to a different note. No need to trigger it manually.

### 1.2.4 Export as HTML
You can export the whole vault as HTML files via `Ctrl + Alt + E`.

## 1.3 Synching with GitHub
Since version [[1. Human readable changelog#[0.8.0] – 2023-08-18|0.8.0]] synchronization with GitHub is enabled.
See [this Obsidian forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/guide-a-relatively-simple-guide-on-syncing-windows-with-ios-using-git/46547) to set it up on your computer.

> [!note]
> You need to ask JML for access to the synching repository.
> 
> If you have non-standard characters (á ô, or a space) in your user account name, install GIT under a different user.
