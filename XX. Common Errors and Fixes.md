<u>Fix/workaround:</u>  
  
## XX.1 Pylon Viewer  
  
### XX.1.1 USB3 Cable Recognized as USB2 Cable  
<u>First occurred:</u> 06-2023  
<u>Description:</u> Pylon refuses to open the camera because it does not properly recognize the USB3 cable  
<u>Fix/workaround:</u> None. It was fixed by systematically switching USB port and camera+cable combination. Then it just worked. The underlying issue is still unknown, and cable producer refuses to acknowledge the issue.  
  
### XX.1.2 Record Button is Non-responsive  
<u>First occurred:</u> 06-2023  
<u>Description:</u> Randomly the record button becomes unresponsive. It can be noticed that normally there should be a pop-up that you need to confirm before the recording starts. In the case of an unresponsive button, you still have the click animation, but no pop-up and no recorded file.  
<u>Fix/workaround:</u> Restart Pylon
