  
  
## 1.1 General Things  
This documentation assumes that you have prior knowledge of DeepLabCut and all other software mentioned.  
Please read the appropriate documentation before starting your work.  
  
A very short introduction to DeepLabCut with links can be found at [2. About DeepLabCut](2.%20About%20DeepLabCut.md).  
  
## 1.2 Maintenance of This Document  
This documentation was created in June 2023 by Thorbjörn Sievert (Lassance Lab, GIGA Neurosciences, University of Liège, Belgium).  
  
This document has been written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and should be available as an [HTML](1.%20About%20this%20Document.md#1.2.4%20Export%20as%20HTML) file for easy reading and sharing, as well as in Obsidian for editing and reading.  
  
### 1.2.1 Template  
Each new note *should* be created automatically with the [basic_template](basic_template.md). This template adds a series of frontmattter/YAML metadata to each note:  
  
```YAML  
created_by: Thorbjörn Sievert  
edited_by:  
  - {{name}}  
  - {{name}}  
  - {{name}}  
  - Thorbjörn Sievert  
Created_at: <% tp.file.creation_date() %>  
Modified_at:   
tags:   
  - {{tag1}}  
  - {{tag2}}  
alias:   
  - {{alias1}}  
  - {{alias2}}  
```  
  
`created_by`: who created the note.  
`edited_by`: list of authors who have edited the note. Please add your name towards the bottom of the list. Newest at the top.  
`Created_ at`: command based on the Templater plugin. Will automatically add the current date when a new note is created.  
`Modified_at`: is populated by the installed linter. Will update on `Ctrl + S`. See [1. About this Document > 1.2.3 Linter](1.%20About%20this%20Document.md#1.2.3%20Linter)  
`tags`: can be added to group different notes with similar topics. Remove curly brackets {{}} to add a tag.  
`alias`: can be added to add an alias for the title. E.g. DLC as an alias for DeepLabCut. The alias can then be found in the search.  
  
### 1.2.2 Changelog  
This vault has two changelogs: [Automatic_Changelog](Automatic_Changelog.md) and [1. Human readable changelog](1.%20Human%20readable%20changelog.md).  
[Automatic_Changelog](Automatic_Changelog.md) is automatically populated via a plugin, but not very informative. Its main purpose is to inform the manual writing of a proper changelog in [1. Human readable changelog](1.%20Human%20readable%20changelog.md).  
  
> [!warning]  
> Please remember to write a proper changelog after each change!  
  
### 1.2.3 Linter  
This vault has a linter installed.  
In case you don’t know what that means, it forces a consistent format across all notes in this vault.  
It can be manually triggered with `Ctrl + Alt + L` to format the current file, or with `Ctrl + Alt + A` for all files in the vault.  
Additionally, manually saving via `Ctrl + S` will also trigger the linter.  
  
> [!note]  
> As of July 2023, the note will be linted automatically when you switch to a different note. No need to trigger it manually.  
  
### 1.2.4 Export as HTML  
You can export the whole vault as HTML files via `Ctrl + Alt + E`.  
  
## 1.3 Synching with GitHub  
Since version [0.8.0](1.%20Human%20readable%20changelog.md#0.8.0) synchronization with GitHub is enabled.  
See [this Obsidian forum post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/guide-a-relatively-simple-guide-on-syncing-windows-with-ios-using-git/46547) to set it up on your computer.  
  
> [!note]  
> You need to ask JML for access to the synching repository.  
>   
> If you have non-standard characters (á ô, or a space) in your user Windows user account name, install GIT under a different user.  
  
## 1.4 Publishing to GitHub  
  
Since version [0.9.0](1.%20Human%20readable%20changelog.md#0.9.0) the vault can be published to a private repository.   
[00 Table of Content](00%20Table%20of%20Content.md) is automatically renamed to `README.md` in the process to have a proper landing page.   
Some things are still breaking, but this is an ongoing process.
